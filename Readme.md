# Image Tag
The HTML **Image tag** is used to embed an image in a web page. It is a ''self-closing'' (empty) element that requires attributes to specify the image source and provide alternative text for accessibility. 

The most fundamental implementation of the Image tag requires the *src* and *alt* attributes. 

- src (Source): Specifies the path or URL to the image file. This can be a relative path (e.g., "images/logo.png") or an absolute URL 
- alt (Alternative Text): Provides a textual description of the image. This text is crucial for accessibility, as screen readers use it to describe the image to visually impaired users. It is also displayed if the image fails to load due to a broken link or network error.
